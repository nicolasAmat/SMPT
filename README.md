### Installation script

To automatically install dependencies (except Python packages and MiniZinc) you
can run the `install_dependencies.sh` script.

### Freezing

The tool can be freezed into standalone executables using
[cx_Freeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by running:
```
$ python3 setup.py build
```

### Type checking

The typing of the code can be checked using [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) by
running:
```
$ mypy smpt --no-strict-optional
```

### Documentation generation

The html documentation can be generated using the sphinx generator by running:
```
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

## Running the model checker

### Input formats

The tool takes as input descriptions in `.pnml` ([Petri Net Markup
Language](https://www.pnml.org/)) and `.net` format (textual format for Petri
nets described in [the
Tina man pages](http://projects.laas.fr/tina/manuals/formats.html)).  

The path to the input Petri net must be specified using the `-n <path>` option.  

SMPT supports the verification of several kind of reachability properties on Petri nets.  
For instance, the following call can be used to check for the existence of
deadlocked states on model `Kanban-00002.net`.

```
$ python3 -m smpt -n nets/Kanban/Kanban-00002.net --deadlock --methods BMC
```

The tools also supports colored Petri nets. In this case, use the option
`--colored` and install the [mcc](https://github.com/dalzilio/mcc) tool.  

The tool supports three main kinds of properties:

* Detection of deadlocks, `--deadlock`: is there a reachable marking with no
  outgoing transitions.
* Quasi-liveness, `--quasi-liveness t`: is there a reachable marking where
transition `t` can fire. You can check the quasi-liveness of several transitions
at the same time by passing a comma-separated list of transition names:
`--quasi-liveness t1,...,tn`.
* Reachability: `--reachability p`: is there a reachable marking where place `p`
is marked (it has at least one token). You can check the reachability of several
places at once by passing a comma-separated list of place names: `--reachability
p1,...,pn`.

The tool also supports properties from the [MCC properties format](https://mcc.lip6.fr/pdf/MCC2020-formula_manual.pdf)
by using the option `--xml` and indicating the path to the `.xml` properties file.
At this time, the support is restricted to:
+ `--xml GlobalProperties.xml`
+ `--xml ReachabilityCardinality.xml`
+ `--xml ReachabilityFireability.xml`

### Polyhedral reductions

For methods that relies on polyhedral reductions, it is possible to
automatically compute the reduction (`--auto-reduce`) or to provide a
pre-computed version with option `--reduce <path>`. It is also possible to save
a copy of the reduced net with the option `--save-reduced-net <path>`.  

Some examples of nets with their corresponding reductions are available in
`nets/E-Abstraction/`.

### Output format

Results are printed in the text format required by the Model Checking Contest
(MCC) which is of the form:
```
FORMULA <id> (TRUE/FALSE)
```

Some options permits to obtain more information:
+ `--verbose` or `-v`: evolution of the methods
+ `--debug`: input/output SMT-LIB exchanged with the SMT solver
+ `--show-techniques`: returns the methods that successfully computed a verdict
+ `--show-time`: print the execution time per property
+ `--show-reduction-ratio`: get the reduction ratio
+ `--show-model`: print the counterexample if it exists
+ `--check-proof`: check the certificate of invariance (if we have one)
+ `--export-proof`: export verdict certificates (inductive invariants (SMT-LIB),
  trace leading to counterexamples
  ([`.scn`](https://projects.laas.fr/tina/manuals/formats.html#14) format),
  etc.)

### Verification methods

The tool is composed of different methods:
+ `INDUCTION`: a basic method that checks if a property is an inductive
invariant. This property is *easy* to check, even though interesting
properties are seldom inductive.
+ `BMC`: Bounded Model Checking is an iterative method to explore the state
space of systems by unrolling their transitions. This method is only useful for
finding counterexamples.
+ `K-INDUCTION`: is an extension of BMC that can also prove invariants.
+ `PDR-COV`, `PDR-REACH` and `PDR-REACH-SATURATED`: Property Directed
Reachability, also known as IC3, is a method to strengthen a property that is
not inductive, into an inductive one. This method can return a verdict
certificate. We provide three different methods of increasing complexity (cf.
\[TACAS2022\]) (one for coverability and two for general reachability).
+ `STATE-EQUATION`: is a method for checking that a property is true for all
*potentially reachable markings* (solution of the state equation). We
implement a refined version that can over-approximate the result with the help
of trap constraints and other structural information, such as NUPN
specifications.
+ `WALK`:  relies on simulation tools to quickly find counterexamples. We
currently use `walk` that is distributed with the [Tina
toolbox](http://projects.laas.fr/tina/).
+ `SMT` and `CP`:  are methods specific to SMPT in the case where nets are
*fully reducible* (the reduced net has only one marking). In this case,
reachable markings are exactly the solution of the reduction equations and
verdicts are computed by solving linear system of equations.

Depending on the input net, SMPT runs a subset of these methods in parallel.  
You can restrict the choice of the verification methods with  `--methods
<method_1> ... <methods_n>`.

The `--auto-enumerative` and `--enumerative <path>` (where the path leads to the
list of markings into the [.aut format](https://projects.laas.fr/tina/manuals/formats.html)) perform an
exhaustive exploration of the state space.

### Tweaking options

We provide a set of options to control the behavior of our verification jobs scheduler such as:
+ `--global-timeout <int>`: add a timeout
+ `--timeout <int>`: add a timeout per property
+ `--mcc`: puts the tool in *competition mode*
